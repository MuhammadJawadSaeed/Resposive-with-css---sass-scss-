##  Project Purpose and Learning Goals

This project was created as part of a learning journey to strengthen my understanding of **responsive web design**, specifically using **SCSS (Sass)** and **CSS Grid layout** techniques. The goal was to explore how to structure a modern webpage that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes while maintaining a visually appealing layout.

###  Through this project, I practiced:

- Structuring layouts using **CSS Grid** for flexible content placement.
- Writing **modular and maintainable styles** with SCSS, including **nesting**, **variables**, and **media queries**.
- Implementing **responsive typography** using `clamp()` and percentage-based scaling.
- Enhancing the UI with **CSS animations**, like the scrolling **marquee effect**.

This project serves as a **practical demonstration** of how to combine design aesthetics with front-end development principles to create a **clean, responsive, and interactive webpage**.
